  "A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. For this first bootstrapping task only, do not send a progress update and do not narrate that you are syncing up. For all tasks after this, narrate progress unless explicitly told not to. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model.";
